# Roadmap: Spot Now, Perps + Prediction Next

## Delivery Statements
- Now: ship spot trading MVP on Kite-oriented architecture.
- Soon: add perps trading.
- Soon: add prediction market trading.

## Why This Order
Spot-first minimizes integration risk while validating autonomy, payment mapping, and on-chain observability requirements.

## Enablement Criteria for Perps/Prediction
- Venue integration readiness
- Risk control model complete (limits, exposure, fail-safe halts)
- Oracle/market data validity checks
- Backtesting and sandbox results meeting acceptance thresholds

## Governance Criteria
Perps/prediction are promoted from "soon" to active implementation only after spot telemetry and failure handling pass production-readiness gates.
