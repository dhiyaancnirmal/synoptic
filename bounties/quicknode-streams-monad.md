# QuickNode Bounty (Full Text)

## Bounty Prompt

QuickNode Streams is an end-to-end data tool that handles extraction, transformation, and loading for robust pipelines. Set it up once and forget it. Projects using Streams to build on Monad are eligible for this bounty.

## Bounty Category

- Feature Usage

## Prize Amount

- `1000`

## Number of Projects Awarded

- `1`

## Winner Breakdown

- 1st Place gets `$1,000` + `$5,000` in QuickNode credits.

## Requirements

Participants must build a project with a working demo that clearly integrates QuickNode Streams as the primary source of blockchain data. The submission should demonstrate Streams being used for data ingestion, transformation, and delivery to the application or database, along with basic documentation or code showing how Streams is configured and how data is consumed.

## What Does a Successful Project Look Like?

A successful project meaningfully leverages QuickNode Streams to power an application's data needs. Examples include using Streams to backfill historical blockchain data, applying Filters to refine or segment incoming data in real time, triggering application workflows from streamed events, or maintaining an entire Streams powered indexed database. Creativity in how Streams simplifies data pipelines and improves reliability is highly encouraged.

## UI/UX Design Requirements

The project must provide a user-friendly interface focused on clear and intuitive data presentation. Applications may be web-based, mobile, CLI, or SDKs, but the primary emphasis should be on how easily end users can explore, understand, and act on the streamed blockchain information.

If the project includes a UI, it should be easy to navigate, well-structured, and designed to make complex blockchain data readable and actionable. Browser-based applications must be deployed to a publicly accessible demo URL. CLI tools or SDKs should offer clear commands, outputs, and documentation.

## How Are We Judging It?

- Completeness of the working demo: The project should function as described, with QuickNode Streams actively powering the core data flow.
- Effective use of QuickNode Streams: How well Streams is integrated as the primary data source, including use of filtering, backfilling, or real-time ingestion.
- Novelty and creativity of the idea: Original use cases or innovative approaches to solving problems.
- UI/UX or developer experience: Quality of the interface, whether UI, CLI, or SDK, and how intuitive it is for users or developers to interact with the project.

## Impact on the Organization

Teams working on this bounty help QuickNode explore novel and creative ways to use Streams in real-world applications. Their projects provide feedback on developer experience, usability, and performance, and surface new use cases and integration patterns that can inform product improvements and documentation.
